# A React App using the Cat API!

https://docs.thecatapi.com/


Cats are the cornerstone of the internet, and it's fitting that that project adds to that rich culture. This site uses the cat API to render a full webpage of cats, complete with leg length, name, etc. as well as an image of the feline friend.

## How to run
First, make sure you install axios on your machine.

npm install axios


I hope you enjoy!

Thank you
